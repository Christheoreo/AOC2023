# AOC 2023

This project was inspired by `https://github.com/SpexGuy/Zig-AoC-Template`

I wanted to use their repo as a template, but I couldn't get it to work with my Zig version.

So, I had a go at creating my own version (but copying their generate code!) and it seems to have worked :D

This year I am using Zig to try and learn the language.

## Created with Zig version 0.11.0
